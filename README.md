# Robotics Club - Obstacle Detection Car
An Obstacle Detection Car uses sensors (ultrasonic) to detect obstacles, a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) to process data, and motors to adjust movement. It identifies obstacles, plans paths, and takes actions like stopping or turning to avoid collisions. Applications include autonomous vehicles, robotics, and warehouse automation.
